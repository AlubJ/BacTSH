BacTSH is a texture page tool for TtGames' games after LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. This tool can create texture sheets from scratch, just add items and save. If you like this tool, and are able to support me financially, I would greatly appreciate it if you could throw me a few bucks [here](https://ko-fi.com/Y8Y219SKRX).

## Getting Started
### Installation
Installing BacTSH is as simple as extracting the contents of the zip file to its own folder, and running the executable file.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Defender may attempt to block BacTSH from running, you can just allow it to run. BacTSH does not do anything malicious, and since it is now open source, you can look through the code yourself and build it if you are worried.

### Game Extraction
TtGames archive the game files into a proprietary format that uses a propreitary compression scheme. To unpack these game files [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) is needed with the [TtGames BMS script](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/ttgames.bms).

To unpack the game files, run QuickBMS, select the BMS script, then select all of the `*.DAT` files using multiselect, then extract to a unique location. Once extracted copy original contents of the game (without the `*.DAT` files) to the extracted contents of the game. Using [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless) you can get the original games to run outside of needing Steam. More info about extracting the games can be found [here](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Nu2#Extracting_game_files).

### Recommended Tools
- [Paint.NET](https://getpaint.net/) - an image editor capable of exporting DirectDraw Surface (`*.dds`) textures. (Alternatives are [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and Photoshop with the [nVidia Texture Tools plugin](https://developer.nvidia.com/texture-tools-exporter)).
